.@oreillyfactor @karlrove- as per the show, an even more serious cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
#icymi: @karlrove &amp; @oreillyfactor discuss what ted cruz did to the great people of iowa- as they went to vote. https://t.co/tv0fnezxse
thank you @billoreilly &amp; @karlrove. ted cruz should be immediately disqualified in iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch.
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesnt want to run against me. he would be so easy to beat!

dr. ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies.
cruz just lied again- i am, and have been totally against #obamacare- repeal and replace!
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
this was sent out from ted cruz- as iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #cruzfraud https://t.co/trm7kucrsu
i will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 p.m. enjoy! @foxnews
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus, either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified.
and finally, cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice - a total lie!
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also, cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters.
during primetime of the iowa caucus, cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for cruz.
ted cruz didnt win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!
great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. we said no and she went hostile. a real dummy! @cnn
on my way to new hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!
anybody who watched all of ted cruzs far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment!
